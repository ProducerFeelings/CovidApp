        <h2>About Humming bird</h2>

        <p class="style-paragraph"> Hummingbird provides a fast way of assessing risk to Covid-19. HummingBird allows 
            users to input their symptoms, history, and other factors and in return receive an assessment of the likelihood
            of having COVID -19. Hummingbird will also provide users with an 
            assessment of infection severity as well as information on getting officially tested and treated. In addition we will be focusing on using information from
            the greater Los Angeles area.
